You can have 10,000 bananas and 1 apple but both are equally likely to be drawn.","Once an item has been drawn (either by the grabber, by groups, or by triggers) as many times as it's stock allows, it will never be drawn again (even if it's group is triggered).","This field can not use any special syntax."]},{"l":"Cost","p":["With a default of 0, this field can be ignored in most cases. It is used as a way to \"spend\" a balance when selecting a table of things. This is mostly used in the context of enemy wave spawning, but it can be used in other places too. For this example, we'll show it in the context of spawning enemies. Starting with a basic table file:","Let's suppose you're spawning a wave of slimes. Passed into the Draw method will be a \"balance\" which will represent the difficulty of the wave to spawn. If that difficulty is over 20 then there will be a chance to spawn a slime_boss. For each grab, the cost of the grab is subtracted from the balance. This repeats until you either run out of drops or you run out of balance."]},{"l":"Groups","p":["When an item with groups is grabbed, all items that share a group are grabbed at the same time. This only consumes 1 grab.","Importantly, groups do not trigger chain reactions. If coin was grabbed then it would also grab soul, but soul's groups are not then grabbed too, so bone is not grabbed."]},{"l":"Triggers","p":["A trigger is a one way group. It will cause anything in the specified group ids to be grabbed, but does not say anything about what group the item is in.","If bone is grabbed then it triggers group 0 and grabs coin.

However, unlike the Range Syntax, this range is weighted to give lower values more frequently than higher values.

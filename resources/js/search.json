Each time you spend an exploration token to uncover a new chunk of land a wave on enemies will spawn from the boundaries of the explored map. Uncovering land is required to locate generators and shops. Generators need to be connected to the portal to progress. Shops will provide new items and buffs to help with the waves of enemies."]},{"l":"Prototype Roadmap","p":["Audio System","Build mode","Building resources","Collectable resources","Combat","Death","Enemies","Fog of war","Item pickup","Player controller","Portal at spawn","Procedural chunk generation","Profiling system","Random generators","Structure generation","Wires, conveyors, pipes, etc...","Working portal"]},{"l":"Bugs","p":["Spamming attack keeps arm up for a long time","Targetting self causes big problem","Sometimes the fog looks super broken :("]}],[{"l":"Enemy spawning","p":["Idly as fog is unveiled","When enough fog is unveiled a wave spawns","Every so often a wave will spawn","Enemies spawn away from you idly"]}],[{"l":"World Generation","p":["Hello!"]}],[{"l":"Controls","p":["Action","B","Build Menu","Ctrl + L-Click","Ctrl + Scroll","Cycle Selected Enemies","Heavy Attack","Jump","Keybind","L-Click","Light Attack","Move","R-Click","Roll","Select Target","Shift","Space","Tab","Toggle Build Mode","W,A,S,D"]}]]

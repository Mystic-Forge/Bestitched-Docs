# Bestitched
Rogue-like survival game where you start in a chunk of land with nothing but an unpowered portal. You start with an exploration token. Each time you spend an exploration token to uncover a new chunk of land a wave on enemies will spawn from the boundaries of the explored map. Uncovering land is required to locate generators and shops. Generators need to be connected to the portal to progress. Shops will provide new items and buffs to help with the waves of enemies.
